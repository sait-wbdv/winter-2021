## Terminology
<dl>
  <dt>Single Threaded</dt>
  <dd>One process handles all requests, one command at a time. The Jacascript run-time environment is single threaded. In other languages, such as PHP, the server is multi-threaded: a new process is created for each individual server request.</dd>
  <dt>Multi Threaded</dt>
  <dd>A process is created for each request and is ended when the response has been sent (or not sent). The PHP run-time environment is multi threaded. There is no event queue (the way we think of it. The server will handle multiple requests at a time, although they are handled synchronously.</dd>
  <dt>Synchronous</dt>
  <dd>One at a time (and in order).</dd>
</dl>

## 1. Install XAMPP

[Install XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)

PHP is part of the classic LAMP stack:
- **Linux**: The traditional server operating system.
- **Apache**: The web server. This is a loose analog to Node.
- **MySQL**: The database server. MariaDB is open used in instead, which we can consider identical to MySQL for the purposes of this course.
- **PHP**: The run-time environment that executes code. This is equivalent to the Javascript run-time environment, although there are differences in the way it is implemented.

### Setting up a local development environment
There are multiple ways to create a local development environment for PHP/MySQL. 
1. Installing directly on your machine and manually configuring your servers. This is a pain. Talk to Tony about how he used to walk uphill both ways to school.
2. Use a package like XAMPP that runs everything for us. We will be using this for the first half of this course. 
3. Use a virtual machine like Local. This is a specific implementation used for Wordpress developement that we'll use in the second half of this course.

**Note**: You can skip XAMPP installation if you already have PHP/MySQL set up on your machine.

## 2. PHP Primer
Once we have PHP/MySQL installed and running:

1. Navigate to XAMPP's `/htdocs` directory on the command line. This might be tricky.
    - Location on Mac OS:

        ```shell
        $ cd ~/.bitnami/stackman/machines/xampp/volumes/root/htdocs
        ```

        If that doesn't work, try this:

        ```shell
        $ cd /opt/lampp/htdocs
        ```

    - Location on PC

        ```shell
        $ cd /c/xampp/htdocs
        ```
        
2. Clone the [PHP Sample Code](https://github.com/sait-wbdv/php-sample-code) repository into this directory.
3. Create your own `in-class` in this directory so you can store your own code.
4. Browse to the [`localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080) (or whichever domain your system is configured to use).
