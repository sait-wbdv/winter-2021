A professional alternative to waterfall development workflows. 

### Core Principles
- **Individuals and Interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working Software over** comprehensive documentation
- **Customer Collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to Change** over following a plan

Agile comes in many flavours but here are three we'll talk about:

- In practice:
  1. Document your Plan A with a lean canvas
  2. Identify the riskiest parts of your plan
  3. Systematically test your plan

### Lean Canvas
Recommended order to complete a lean canvas:
1. _Customer segment_: Target customers and users.
2. Top 3 _Problems_ experienced by your segment.
3. _Unique Value Proposition_: A single, clear compelling message that turns an unaware visitor into an interested prospect (elevator pitch).
4. _Solutions_: Outline a possible solution for each problem.
5. _Customer channels_: List your path to customers.
6. _Revenue streams_: List your sources of revenue.
7. _Cost structure_: List your fixed and variable costs.
8. _Key Metrics_: List the key numbers that tell you how your business is doing.
9. _Unfair Advantage_: Something that can't be easily copied or bought.

## [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban)
- Core Principles
  - Understanding
  - Agreement
  - Respect
  - Leadership
  - Flow
  - Customer Focus
  - Transparency
  - Balance
  - Collaboration
- In practice:
  - Each process issues requests (kanban) to its suppliers when it consumes its supplies.
  - Each process produces according to the quantity and sequence of incoming requests.
  - No items are made or transported without a request.
  - The request associated with an item is always attached to it.
  - Processes must not send out defective items, to ensure that the finished products will be defect-free.
  - Limiting the number of pending requests makes the process more sensitive and reveals inefficiencies.
