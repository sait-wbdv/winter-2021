## Terminology

Source: [Copyright claim vs Copyright strike](https://vidiq.com/blog/post/monetize-youtube-channel-copyright-claim/)

Copyright claim
: "When you receive a copyright claim, YouTube, as a third party, is basically saying that you the creator, can use the copyright ownerâ€™s content, but the owner of that copyrighted content has the right to place adverts on your video and earn income from it."

Copyright strike
: "If the owner asserts their rights to their own content, your video will be removed from your channel and you will also receive a copyright strike. Three copyright strikes and your channel will be terminated. In extreme cases, you could find yourself in legal hot water and have to defend yourself in court."

### Key Takeaways
- TLDR; Even if you have a valid claim of Fair Use, you can still get sued and it'll cost a lot of money to win.
- See: [Canadian Copyright Basics](https://sait-wbdv.github.io/cheatsheets/copyright/)
- American Copyright
  - by default, you need permission/license to use a copyrighted work
  - exceptions under Fair Use
  - 4 Factors that must be balanced:
    1. [The purpose and character of the use](https://youtu.be/5A_i-sB9H0Q?t=508);
        - "By far the most important factor"
        - Also referred to as a "transformative work" such as a clear commentary/criticism purpose.
    2. [The nature of the copyrighted work](https://youtu.be/5A_i-sB9H0Q?t=580)
        - Is the work factual or fictional in nature?
        - Factual works have less protection than fictional works.
        - Is considered the least important of the four factors.
    3. [The amount and substantiality of the portion used](https://youtu.be/5A_i-sB9H0Q?t=605)
        - People are only allowed to use the minimum amount necessary to get the point of their commentary/criticism across.
    4. [The effect of the use upon the potential market](https://youtu.be/5A_i-sB9H0Q?t=643)
        - Your work can't replace the need for the original work.
- Parody is often protected but satire is almost never protected.
  - Parody comments on the underlying work.
  - Satire comments on the world at large.

### Terminology

Soundtrack
: "A rights cleared music tool designed for Twitch creators" (copy and pasted from their website). It apparently allows [streamers to play music while they're live](https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21495243/twitch-soundtrack-streaming-music-soundcloud-distrokid-facebook-gaming).

### Key Takeaways
- To make a song stream safe: a platform has to secure **master recorded rights**, **publishing rights** and **mechanical licenses** (to release the music).
- Additionally:
  - to use music in a public setting, a **public performance license** is required;
  - for music used in a video setting such as an advertisment, film or _recorded livestream_, a **synchonization license** is required.
- _Allegedly_, Twitch has not paid for synchonization licenses (the most expensive of the bunch).
