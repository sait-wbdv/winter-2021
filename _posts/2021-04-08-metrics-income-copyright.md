## 1. Pirate Metrics
### Learning Objectives
- Define pirate metrics.
- Discuss common pirate metrics patterns.
- Find examples of companies using pirate metrics.

### Materials
- [Pirate Metrics (AARRR)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcDpxG_Wz-k)

### Terminology
AARRR
: An acronym for the key metrics of a business.
    - _Acquisition_: How do customers find you? Who are they? Usually takes the form of a Call-to-Action -> opt-in list.
    - _Activation_: How do you get a customer to care? How many do? Usually takes the form of a secondary CTA -> ???
    - _Retention_: How many customers are returning? Who isn't? Usually happens after Activation.
    - _Referral_: How can customers become advocates? How many are advocates? Usually leads to another Acquisition.
    - _Revenue_: How many customers convert? Who didn't? How much was made and how much did it cost?

Opt-out
: A user is added by default and needs to request to be removed. Examples: a bought list or a list you built yourself.

Opt-in
: A user requests to be added. Conversion rates are much higher for opt-in lists but are more difficult to build. Example: an email list built with a Subscribe form (or social media follows).

Permission-based marketing list
: Usually an email or subscriber list of potential customers that have opted-in to (i.e. given permission to be added). This is usually the goal of the Acquisition stage.

CPA
: Cost per Acquisition. How much does it cost to generate a first-time sign-up. Costs can involve PPC ads, traditional advertising, sales staff, etc.

Customer Funnel
: A measurement of the journey customers take through the sales process of a business, usually from acquisition to the first sale. Can be qualitative (gut feeling) or quantitative (statistical).

### Key Takeaways
- The specific definition of each of the AARRR stages is very situational and will dependent on how high you (or a business) sets the bar.
- Startups are often very interested in pirate metrics, specifically CPA. As a potential developer for a startup, it's a good idea to become familiar with the terminology.
- Permission-based marketing lists should be considered a valueable asset, often more important than the sales themselves.

## 2. Organic social media campaigns
### Learning Objectives
- Compare general pirate metrics to their social media counterparts.
- Discuss the role of social media in the life-cycle of a business.
- Find a good example of a local business effectively using an organic social media campaign.

### Materials
- Cheatsheet: [Common Business Use Cases for Social Media](https://sait-wbdv.github.io/winter-2021/cheatsheets/social/income/business-use-cases/)
- [10 Ways to Measure Social Media Engagement (Plus 7 Tools to Track It!)](https://www.singlegrain.com/blog-posts/10-ways-to-measure-social-media-engagement/)

### Terminology
Marketing Campaign
: A business promotion that has 
    - a beginning, 
    - an end and 
    - a measurable goal.

Follows (Acquisition)
: When a user opts-in to follow you.

Engagement (Activation/Retention)
: When a user likes, comments, mentions.

User Shares (Referral)
: When a user shares your profile/campaign with some or all of their followers.

Growth Rate
: The number of new subscribers/followers/connections per some-period-of-time.

Cumulative Growth Rate
: A measure of total subscribers/followers/connections over time.

### Key Takeaways
- Organic social media marketing campaigns require constant content generation. Where is this content coming from? Who's generating it?
- Social media consultants are usually paid on a flat rate per month for page management and (often) content generation.
- General tips: 
  - use pictures of faces (or pets or food) to increase engagement;
  - publish on a regular schedule;
  - strengthen your/their neighbours (i.e. don't promote yourself directly, promote others).

## 3. Social media marketing as a business
### Learning Objectives
- Define common marketing and sales terms.
- Understand the basic metrics for measuring the success of a PPC campaign.

### Materials
- [How to Start a Social Media Marketing Agency (SMMA) 2020](https://youtu.be/754pSl_wm1E)

### Terminology
B2C
: Business-to-Customer services/relationships. For example, local restaurants selling to customers.

B2B
: Business-to-Business services/relationships. For example, food supplier selling to local restaurant.

PPC
: Pay-per-click advertising. Ads that you pay for when a user clicks on them and is directed to a landing page. For example, Facebook, Instagram and Google Ads all run on the PPC model.

CPM
: Cost per thousand impressions. A term used when you pay by the page view. This is an older model that is rarely used online (unless you're a successful Youtuber).

Media Buy
: The amount of money a business budgets for the purchase of PPC ads.

ROI
: Return on Investment. Is the value worth the price you're paying?

Conversion Rate
: The number of sales divided by the number of ad clicks (%).

### Key Takeaways
- Most PPC platforms use some form auction system to set the price of a click.
- Conversion rates are a key metric to measuring ROI and is usually tricky to set up, depending on what you're converting.
- General tips:
  - add scarcity ("This month only!"),
  - focus on the visual hierarchy of your Call to Action,
  - geo-target your ads!
