## 1. Install XAMPP
### Learning Objectives
- Summarize the differences between the Node and PHP server environments.
- Install XAMPP or a similar PHP/MySQL development environment.
- Locate the local location of the PHP web directory.

### Terminology
LAMP Stack
: A server environment that uses Linux (operating system), Apache (web server), MySQL (database) and PHP (codebase). Wordpress runs on the LAMP stack.

Single Threaded
: One process handles all requests, one command at a time. The Jacascript run-time environment is single threaded. In other languages, such as PHP, the server is multi-threaded: a new process is created for each individual server request.

Multi Threaded
: A process is created for each request and is ended when the response has been sent (or not sent). The PHP run-time environment is multi threaded. There is no event queue (the way we think of it). The server will handle multiple requests at a time, although they are handled synchronously.

Synchronous
: One at a time (and in order).

### Materials
- **Note**: If you already have `php` and `mysql` set up on your machine, you can skip this step.
- [Install XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)
- [XAMPP startup checklist](https://github.com/sait-wbdv/php-sample-code/)
    - Once XAMPP is set up and you've located your `htdocs` folder, clone this repo into that folder.
    
### Key Takeaways
- `php` is ooooold, pre-dating both Javascript and CSS. Many of the patterns it uses are just as old.
- Unlike Node, a `LAMP` server has one web directory where all `php` files need to be located. It's usually called `htdocs`.
- Installing `XAMPP` is pretty straight forward but finding the web directory can be tricky on Mac OS. The [XAMPP startup checklist](https://github.com/sait-wbdv/php-sample-code/) has more details.

## 2. Import `aviano-db` database
### Learning Objectives
1. Locate the [`phpMyAdmin` control panel](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/) in XAMPP.
2. Import a database using the `phpMyAdmin` control panel.
3. Connect to a database using `php` and the [`mysqli` extension](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.mysqli.php).

### Materials
- [Sample Vehicle Rentals Database](https://github.com/sait-wbdv/php-sample-code/tree/main/mysql/rentals)

### Key Takeaways
- Connecting to a database as the `root` user is risky. Instead, we'll create a new db user with limited access permissions.
- The goal for today is to import and make a test connection to our rentals database. We'll talk about SQL in detail tomorrow.

## 3. PHP Introduction
### Learning Objectives
1. Summarize the differences in syntax between Javascript and PHP.
2. Understand how `php` tags are implemented.
3. Refactor an `html` website to use `php` partials.

### Materials
- [PHP: Getting started](https://github.com/sait-wbdv/php-sample-code/tree/main/php)

### Key Takeaways
- `php` is not a focus of this course but some basic knowledge will help navigate `mysql` and Wordpress later on. Today we'll take a look at basic syntax and examples of some simple `php` websites.

## Open lab-time
1. Get `php` and `mysql` running on your local machine!
