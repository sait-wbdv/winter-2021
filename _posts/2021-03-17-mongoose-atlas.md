## Homework
1. Review
    - [Create, read, update and delete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) on Wikipedia
    - [What Is a REST API?](https://www.sitepoint.com/developers-rest-api/) on SitePoint

    - [Using dotenv package to create environment variables](https://medium.com/@thejasonfile/using-dotenv-package-to-create-environment-variables-33da4ac4ea8f)
2. Introduction to CRUD and Mongoose
    - Read: [NoSQL vs SQL Databases](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained/nosql-vs-sql)
    - Read: [Mongoose CRUD](https://coursework.vschool.io/mongoose-crud/) (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
    - Reference: [Mongoose Getting Started](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/)
3. MongoDB Atlas
    - Read: [Get Started with Atlas](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-started/)
    - Read: [How to host a RESTful Node.js server with MongoDB Atlas database on Heroku](https://dev.to/cpclark360/how-to-host-a-restful-node-js-server-with-mongodb-atlas-database-on-heroku-1opl)
        - Note:
            - CORS headers are often not needed with Atlas... but sometimes they are.
            - We will be connecting to Mongoose a little differently that what is shown in this article.
