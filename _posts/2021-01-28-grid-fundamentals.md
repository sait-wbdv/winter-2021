## Morning reflection
### Housekeeping
1. [CPNT 260 Assignment 3](https://github.com/sait-wbdv/assessments/tree/master/cpnt260)
2. Dailies feedback
    - Decline in submissions for W3W?
    - Copy and paste is fine, but...
        - Try making something from scratch.
        - Add comments: problems, victories, questions.
    - `body` and `head` are not needed in Codepen.
    - Comment out broken code if something isn't working and you need help with it.

## Lecture/Live code
### Learning Objectives
- Discuss the differences between Flexbox and CSS Grid.
- Identify the  strengths and weaknesses of each technology.
- Define a Grid template using traditional length units.
- Define a Grid template using the `fr` unit.
- Layout a web page with Grid names and areas.

### Terms
- See: [Complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)

### Materials
- Gist: [Starter Code](https://gist.github.com/acidtone/d946ea7147e60568d7f8262b5e7be449)
- Gist: [Traditional sidebar layout](https://gist.github.com/acidtone/4c73631fe86425523c3161743a32f03b)
- Traditional layout with grid areas:

### General implementation process
1. Define your container. All direct children will become grid items.
2. Define your Grid template.
3. Explicitly place items, if needed.

### Key Takeaways
- Like Flexbox, Grid items are defined as the direct children of the container.
- Flexbox vs Grid: Flex operates in one direction like a sentence (in `row` direction) and Grid operates in two dimensions like a spreadsheet.
- Unlike Flexbox, grids don't change axis; columns are always in the up-down direction and rows are left-right. 
- The grid _template_ is not a part of the DOM. It cannot by styled or targetted with selectors. Its purpose is to guide the positioning of the grid items.
- Implicit item placement happens automatically: the browser will place items on the grid in source order. You can control this with various _explicit_ placement properties.
- Grid cells cannot take non-rectangular shapes (like a Tetris "L"). They must be rectangular.
- Half the grid declarations seem to be shorthand properties.

## Open lab-time
### Tips for learning
- Beginners
  - Try defining your grid columns using units you already know (`px`, `rem`, `em`, `ch`, etc), _then_ experiment with `fr` units.
  - Define traditional layouts using `grid-area` and `grid-template-areas` at first, _then_ redefine the same grid in another project using `grid-column`, `grid-row` and the `span` keyword.
    - Digital Ocean: [CSS Grid Layout: The Span Keyword](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/css-css-grid-layout-span-keyword)
- Intermediate
  - Place items explicitly using Grid lines.
    - [CSS Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/)
  - Implement the `minmax()` function to create "squishy" columns (and rows).
    - Grid by Example: [Introducing minmax()](https://gridbyexample.com/video/series-minmax/)
  - Use the `repeat()` function to create repeating rows or columns. This will prep you for auto-generated columns below.
- Advanced
  - Auto-generate Grid tracks with `auto-fill`, `auto-fit` in combination with `repeat()` and play with stacking order.
    - Grid by Example:

  - How do absolutely positioned elements work in a grid layout?
    - See: 
      - Grid by Example: [Absolute positioning and grid items](https://gridbyexample.com/video/absolute-positioning/)
  - Overlap items using explicit grid line placement.
