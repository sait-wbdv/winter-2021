## 1. Small World Theory of Networks
### Learning Objectives
- Define homophily and its two types: induced and choice.
- Understand the concept of network effects.
- Define Dunbar's number and relate it to the concept of social cognitive load.

### Materials
- [Small World Theory of Networks](https://sait-wbdv.github.io/winter-2021/cheatsheets/social/small-world-networks/)

### Key Takeaways
- As a network grows, the connections between the nodes of that network grow exponentially.
- People only have the capacity for about 200 social relationships.
- The more social connections you create, the less you will know those people, on average.

## 2. Principls of Social Collaboration
### Learning Objectives
- Define Social Capital and its two main types: bonding and bridging capital.
- Summarize the two main classifications of media sharing: _broadcast_ and _communication_ media.
- Define a community of practice.
- Define the three levels/phases of collective action.

### Materials
- [Principles of Social Collaboration](https://sait-wbdv.github.io/winter-2021/cheatsheets/social/collaboration/)

### Key Takeaways
- A small minority of users are responsible for the majority of the content.
- Social collaboration in software is very effective. See: [Steve Bomber on Open Source](https://youtu.be/sPQViNNOAkw?t=758)
- Social tools are value agnostic. See [Pro-Ana](https://youtu.be/sPQViNNOAkw?t=1032).
- The larger a social media following is, the less a creator can interactively communicate with that following and the more they will instead broadcast to the following.

## 3. The Dark Side of Social
### Learning Objectives
- Understand and discuss the downsides of social media.

### Materials
- [5 Crazy Ways Social Media Is Changing Your Brain Right Now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HffWFd_6bJ0)
- [You Will Wish You Watched This Before You Started Using Social Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmEDAzqswh8)

### Key Takeaways
- 5-10% of individuals cannot control the amount of time they spend on social media.
- Social media creates many of the same effects on the brain as drugs. A reduction in the brain's white matter reduces attention span, emotional processing and decision making.
- Heavy media users perform much worse at task-switching activities due to reduction in the ability to focus attention and commit information to memory.
- In face-to-face communication, 30-40% is sharing our own experiences but online, nearly 80% of the content is self-involved. 
- Social media tools are designed to be addictive because the companies that build them are incentivized to optimize user screen time.

## Breakout Activity
In groups of 4-5, analyze the effect of social tools on niche culture:

**Cameras mandatory, comb your hair**
- Share a niche community of your choice that you are a member of. We'll define "niche" as one not shared by another member of your breakout group (two tops). Alternatively, you can choose a broad group that most of you are members of but focus on a niche sub-group within that broader catagory.
- Is this group created through Induced or Choice Homophily?
- Did this niche exist before 2005?
- What instituions related to that niche were disrupted by social tools? Did they adapt? If so, how? Was it effective?
- What are the top content creators in this niche that you follow? What platforms do they use? Do they have your trust?
- Are there opposing views in this niche? How are they handled by the community?

Link to your top niche content creators (with the niche) in the `winter-2021` Slack Channel. Add a reaction to your faves.

After the session, Tony will pick volunteers for a Fishbowl discussion on the best and weirdest. 

**Cameras mandatory for active speakers**
